## Why use React ?

As already mentioned in the introduction we now know that it is a javascript library to build beautiful user interfaces. React is also:

1. **_Declarative:_** We as developers just need to focus on designing views for each state change in our application. React will update and render the right components when the data changes. The code becomes more predictable and easy to debug.
2. **_Component-Based:_** In component based approach we encapsulate behaviours into small units called components. They manage their own state.This make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code.
3. **_Technology-stack agnostic:_** React does not care what tech-stack you use. You can develop new features in React without rewriting code. It can render on the server using node.

### Let's cut the chase and dive into real code examples

## Hello World with React

Now that you have a basic knowledge of the main concepts of React, it's time to see a concrete example. Let's start by creating a new `index.html` file containing the following code:
    
    
    
       
          
       
       
          http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js"> src="">https://fb.me/react-0.12.2.js">
          ">https://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.12.2.js">
          ">https://www.telerik.com/hello.jsx">
          ">https://www.telerik.com/main.jsx">
