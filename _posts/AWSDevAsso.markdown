 I would like to share my experience on how I passed the Developer Associate Exam. I studied for about 1 month. I score 927/1000.

## The material courses that helped me in my Journey to get my first Associate Certification are as follows:

[Acloudguru](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate/)

This course is one of the main training courses I used for my review. The instructors have a good understanding of the topics and the best part about acloudguru is that they have summaries at the end of every lecture and a summary of every section at the end of the section 
The course is good and consists of 25 hours of video lectures with a few interactive labs.

The second training material I used. I like his approach and the way he explained the lesson. He provided the basic understanding of the AWS services. An excellent training course.

## Topics to Focus on:
1. Lambda
2. AWS SAM
3. Kinesis
4. KMS
5. Data Pipeline
6. Cloud Formation
7. Code Deploy
8. DynamoDB
9. EC2 Instances
10. ECS
11. Cognito
12. SQS
13. API calls
14. API Gateway
15. Cloudfront
16. IAM roles and users
17. Elastic Beanstalk
18. X-ray

## My Advice:
* Stay clear of dumps, instead use AWS practice tests 
* Cheating is not the way to pass. Instead look for a practice test that will teach you how to answer the exam based on your own knowledge and what you learned from the training materials you had used.
* You might not understand a lot of topics in the first go but dont panic, that's normal.
* If you don't understand a topic, dig deep in it. Google about it, watch Youtube videos on it and read about it on AWS Whitepapers. After 3-4 hours of research you should 100% get that topic.
* Looking at things in a bigger perspective, while you are watching courses they might teach about one topic but during the exam the questions are based on a mixed architecture of a lot of services.
* On the exam make sure to double check your answers before you submit it. Do not rush.
* Focus and use as many serverless offerings as possible.
* Go thru FAQ’s and Cheat Sheets of each AWS services applicable to the Developer Associate course

## Extra Things which helped me:
* Being involved with the AWS Community around me. As programmers being involved in communities is really important for a constant learning. I was involved in a lot of with a lot of communities around me in Melbourne like
1. [DevCop Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/DevCoP-Melbourne/)
2. [AWS Programming and Tools](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-AWS-Programming-and-Tools-Meetup/)
* Organized a workshop, on 16th of November I developed, documented and delivered an AWS workshop to 160 Students pan university.
* I started my cloud journey by giving and passing the AWS Cloud Practioner exam, which really helped to clear my basic concepts

## Developer Associate vs Solutions Architect
If you have experience with traditional IT functions such as networking, security, server management, Linux or Windows administration, your background will help you understand how these services work.  In this case, the solutions architect exam would be a better place to start as your experience will help you understand how cloud environments operate, which is one of the key topics in the exam.  

On the other hand, if you have experience with scripting, programming or performing QA activities, the developer associate exam is the better choice for you. While preparing for this exam, you will learn about the developer tools that AWS offers — and build confidence in building using AWS.
