Hello everyone! Today I want to write about the Pandas library (link to the website). Pandas stands for “Python Data Analysis Library”. According to the Wikipedia page on Pandas, “the name is derived from the term “panel data”, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets.” But I think it’s just a cute name to a super-useful Python library!
Pandas is quite a game changer when it comes to analyzing data with Python and it is one of the most preferred and widely used tools in data munging/wrangling if not THE most used one.
